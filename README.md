The Odin Project: Mastermind Project

This is the second project from the Object Oriented Programming Basics part of the Ruby course from The Odin Project. Its a playable mastermind via the command line.

## Project Requirements

Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code. Add an option so the human player can choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser. If the player chooses to be the creator, the computer should try to guess it. 

In my version, I included an extra option for situations where the user wants to create a secret code for another person to crack.

## About The Odin Project

> The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
